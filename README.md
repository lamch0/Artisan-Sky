# Artisan’s Sky

## Project Overview
Famous exhibitions of creations and artwork are often in physical forms that require a venue with extensive manpower and resources. The entry-level of such exhibitions is evidently not for everyone to share, promote and perform transactions related to their work. Artisan’s Sky is a web-based software targeting specifically societies in colleges and universities as well as the public to serve as a platform targeted in exchanging artwork and designs. This platform also provides social-media-like functions to serve as a marketplace for artists and designers to promote their artwork. This marketplace provides a channel for personnel and societies to create and share artwork requests upon their requirements. People could share and exchange ideas and work freely and without constraints.
